Information Managagement System allowing create, read, update, delete on a database that is stored on Google Cloud Platform. Database shows customers first and sirnames, items names and price and orders made by customers for items. Can also calculate the cost of each order made by a customer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
JDK - to develop java code. To download JDK: https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
JRE - run time environment for java program. Comes with JDK on link above
Maven - to manage all the dependencies. To get maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone the folder from git hub using this link: https://github.com/AhmadNaeemQA/ims-starting-point.git
Open the folder on Eclipse
Go intto src/main/java folder
Open com.qa.ims.utils Utils.java
Change MYSQL_URL = "34.105.231.76:3306"; to the ip address of the database and port number
Change DATABASE_NAME = "ims"; to the database name
Go into com.qa.ims package
Open Runer.java
Run the java code
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Junit tests tests the resulting values from methods against whats expected. It also gives coverage percentage of code that is being tested.
To run the junit tests:
1) In the ims-starting-pont folder go over src/test/java and right click on it
2) They click on coverage as Junit test
```
